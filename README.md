https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kalpana.parmar/viz/COVIDTableauAnalysis/Dashboard1

In this Portfolio Project I have analyzed the COVID cases across the world using Tableau.
In the first visualization, created a text table showing Total COVID cases, Total Death cases & Death percentage.
Then created a BAR chart showing Total Death counts across the continents.
Using the Symbol Map, shown the percentage of population infected by COVID across the world.
Then using the Line Chart, shown the population infected in different location during the different months of the years and also put a filter on location.
